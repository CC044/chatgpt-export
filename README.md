# chatgpt-export

Simple script to format and download ChatGPT conversations to markdown files

## Usage

- Copy file contents of `exportMarkdown.min.js`
- To save ChatGPT conversation, paste into the browser console

## Limitations

This is a trivial implementation as ChatGPT currently does not support sharing or exporting conversations. It may break with future changes.
