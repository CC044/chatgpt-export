# chatgpt-export

Simple script to format and download ChatGPT conversations to markdown and JSON files.

## Usage

### Markdown

- Copy file contents of `exportMarkdown.min.js`
- Paste into the browser console
### JSON

- Copy file contents of `exportJSON.min.js`
- Paste into the browser console
## Limitations

This is a trivial implementation as ChatGPT currently does not support sharing or exporting conversations. It may break with future changes.
